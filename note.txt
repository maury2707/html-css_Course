This are my personal notes for the Course "Curso definitivo de HTML Y CSS".

* The course includes a lot of usefull information since the begining and it is very clear when it comes to the frameworks, technologies, how does this elements works at a high level and
bring clear explenation from the same ones.
It is very usefull when it comes to look at a north about what to study how the Web development is constructed, Im gonna go back to this first clases eventually if needed.

First Topic.
* Web Page Anatomy.
    * Header 
        Within the header we can find:
            * Logo.
            * Navigation.
    * Main 
        content / SideBar (Optiona & editable).
        This is the general content that we find in a web Page. 
    * Footer.
        Here is the lowest part of the Wen Page.

* index.html
    The index.htm is the landing page, is the first page that the browser will consider.
    
    *Anatomy.
        The anatomy of the HTMLs is, in general constructed by labels...

        * <!DOCTYPE html> // This line is what address to the Browser that everything
        after that line will be HTML 5.
        
        * <html lang="es"> 
            CONTENT 
          </html> // This will be the parent container, absolutely
        everything will be inside of this label.
        
        * <head>
            CONTENT
        </head> // In the head (Dont get confused with the header of a web page) you
        will add everything that is important to get loaded for the proyect, but will
        not be visual for the end user (Dependencies, founts, css, founts, etc...).

        
        * <body>
            Here is everything that is visual or interactable for the en user.
        </body>
* labels.
    <meta charset="UTF-8" /> Meta labels are lables that you dont really need to
    close like the rest, in this case, we add an atribute called "charset="UTF-8"", 
    which indicates to the browser to understand special characters like "ñ", "´", etc...
        * another atribute is "name="description" content="this is the description of 
        the web page when the user looks for it in the browser"".
        * name="robots" content="index,follow"
        * An important atribute is the <title> This is the name of the page <title/>
            This is the name that will be shown in the tab at the top of the browser.
        *  name="viewport" content="width=device-width, inictial-scale=1.0"
            This will fit the sice of the page to the respective device is being used.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    For the Body, we have 2 types of labels; Container lables & Content Lables.
    * The Container labels will have more labels within.
        This helps to keep the structure of the web page. 
    * The Content will have text, multimedia or any reder content.
    
    /*
    Combinators CSS
    For css the combinators are the next
    
    label + label2{}           For this case, the statements will affect the labels after the "+", in this case, is label2 that, in html, are located right after label.
    label ~ label2{}           For this case, the statements will affect the labels after the "~", in this case, is label2 that, in html, has label as genera sibling - This applies at the same jerarchy level.
    label > label2{}           Same as above, but in this case, we are looking for inner lables within label, in this case, will be applied to label2 within lable.
    label label2{}
